			<h1>Registration</h1>
			<p>
				Woo! You're joining! I don't really know what you're joining, but I'm so freaking happy that you're joining! You're gonna make a great member, I just know it! All of the other members are gonna be like, "Damn, this dude(ette) is the best memeber ever!" Seriously, that's probably what they're gonna say about you. You've got so much potential! And to unlock it, all you've got to do is fill out a few of these fields. DON'T WORRY THOUGH! This page is totally secure, and we promise that we won't ever look at any of the information that you submitted to us. We'll only forward it straight on to the <s>advertisers</s> people who need it to verify yourself.
			</p>
			<p>
				So, if you could just fill out the following fields, that'd be great!

			<form id="registration" name="registration" method="post" onsubmit="return false">
				<table>
